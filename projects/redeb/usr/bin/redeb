#description     :This script attempts to backup your tweaks, packages,....,everything what has a debian structure and what is not offered by cydia.
#                :You can save the current versions of your packages without any major hassle and without the fear that you will update a tweak and will not
#                :be able to "downgrade" to a lower and compatible version.

#updates         :v. 0.5 : first version which was put to github
#                :v. 0.6 : added some cleansing after the packages are redebed, changed the structure of log files and deb files to Documents/Redeb
#                :v. 0.7 : possibility to list packade bundle IDs, if those are unknown for the user
#                :v. 0.8 : minor code corrections, mainly related to the output and command prompts during the script runtime
